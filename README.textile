Dependencies
============

A port of Merb's dependency system to a Rails plugin.


Example
=======

Create a config/dependencies.rb file that looks like:

    dependency 'gem'
    dependency 'gem', '1.0.1'
    dependency 'gem', :require_as => 'Gem'
    dependency 'gem', :env => %w(test staging)

Install the gems into your project and keep them up to date using:

    rake dependencies:sync
